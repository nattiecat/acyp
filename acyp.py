# a simple affine cypher program for encrypting and decrypting ASCII text.
# A plaintext character 'p' is encrypted  by an invertible function 'e' on
# Z_mod_256 with e(p) = a*p + b (mod 256), where 'a' and 'b' are elements
# of Z_mod_256 that act as the 'keys' to the cypher 'e'. 'a' must be rela-
# tively prime to 256 (so that any odd integer (mod 256) will do) in order 
# for 'e' to be invertible, in which case the inverse function 'd' acts to
# decrypt a cyphertext character 'q' with d(q) = 達*(q - b), where '達' is 
# the multiplicative inverse of 'a' in Z_mod_256. 'b' is any old integer
# (mod 256). Good for 'b'.
